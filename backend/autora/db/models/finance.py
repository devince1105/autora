"""Budgets and the transaction ledger (logs/platform/06_BUSINESS_REVENUE.md).

``transactions`` is the single financial fact table. Revenue and expenses are views over it.
Rows are append-only: a database trigger rejects UPDATE and DELETE (migration 0002), so a
correction is a new compensating transaction, never an edit.
